# Programming with Data Project
This was the final project for a programming with data course that I took during my first year of university. Completed with @imisilawal

## Date Completed
December 2021

## Description
This terminal based Python project integrates various techniques learned in class to analyze UN nation data. It reads CSV files containing country information, prompts the user for two countries, and generates graphs comparing their population, population density, and number of endangered species. 

This project uses two libraries: Matplotlib is utilized for graph creation, and Numpy for reading CSV data. Resulting statistics are displayed in the terminal. 

## Running the Project
With the previously mentioned libraries installed and imported, simply run the Python file on any terminal.
